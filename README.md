# Solidity Smart Contracts Collection

A collection of Solidity smart contracts demonstrating various Ethereum development concepts such as storage, mappings, inheritance, voting systems, ERC standards, and more.

---

## üìÅ Project Overview

This repository contains multiple standalone smart contracts created for learning, experimentation, and demonstration of key Solidity principles. Each contract focuses on a specific topic or pattern in Ethereum smart contract development.

## üìú Contracts Included

| Contract | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **1_Storage.sol** | Basic contract demonstrating variable storage and retrieval. |
| **2_Owner.sol** | Contract showing ownership and access control patterns. |
| **3_Ballot.sol** | Simple voting (ballot) contract. |
| **AddressBook.sol** | Contract for managing and storing user addresses. |
| **Arrays.sol** | Examples of array manipulation and iteration. |
| **BasicMath.sol** | Implements arithmetic and math operations safely. |
| **ControlStructures.sol** | Demonstrates loops, conditionals, and other control flows. |
| **EmployeeStorage.sol** | Example of structured employee data storage. |
| **ERC20.sol** | Minimal implementation of ERC20 token standard. |
| **ERC721.sol** | Minimal implementation of ERC721 (NFT) standard. |
| **Errors.sol** | Shows how to use custom errors and revert messages. |
| **Imports.sol** | Demonstrates Solidity import functionality. |
| **inheritance.sol** | Demonstrates contract inheritance and polymorphism. |
| **Mapping.sol** | Example of using mappings for efficient data access. |
| **MinimalToken.sol** | A simple fungible token contract. |
| **OtherContracts.sol** | Miscellaneous experimental contracts. |
| **SillyStringUtils.sol** | String manipulation examples. |
| **Structs.sol** | Demonstrates how to define and use structs. |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Requirements

- **Remix IDE** (recommended for testing)  
- **Solidity Compiler:** `^0.8.17`  
- **MetaMask** for contract interaction  
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts** for ERC implementations  

---

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)  
2. Create a new workspace and add these `.sol` files.  
3. Compile using Solidity version `0.8.17` (or the version specified in each contract).  
4. Deploy contracts using **Injected Provider** (MetaMask) or **Remix VM**.  
5. Interact with deployed contracts via the Remix UI.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

These contracts are for **learning and educational purposes only** and should not be used in production without proper security review.
